Project Overview:
The provided code effectively meets the requirements to build an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application. Users can start, pause, reset the stopwatch, and record multiple lap times accurately.
Additionally, the application includes the alarm page that allows users to set an alarm for a specific time.
Users can define the time at which the alarm should trigger, and the application will alert them when the time arrives.
The page also displays the history of set alarms, showing the previous alarm times and when they were triggered, allowing users to track past alarms.
